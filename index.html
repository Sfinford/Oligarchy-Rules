    <h2 id="Setting Up The Game">Setting Up The Game</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>To set up the game, first pick up the cards. You need to separate the cards into 2 different piles. One should contain the number cards, the nobles, the thiefs, the peasants, and the pet rocks. The other should contain all other cards. Place the deck with the royals in the left slot of the card organizer. Place the other deck in the middle slot. The right will be the discard pile. Deal three cards to the first player, four cards to the second, and in the expansion, five cards to the third. Turns go in order from who had the least to most starting cards.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Taking Your Turn">Taking Your Turn</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>When it is your turn, there is a process you need to follow. First, calculate (but don't apply) the royal bonus. This is described later in the rules. Then apply Ace stealing. Also described later. Afterwards, draw cards until you draw a match with the cards you already have or you draw a sorcerer. If you have a match and it is of cards numbered anywherer from 3-9, then discard those two cards and search the discard pile for a card with a number one higher. If none is found in the discard pile then search the drawing deck. If you are the player that went first, change the cycle counter by 1 at the start of your turn. If it is 4, instead of going to 5, go back to 1. Do not change the cycle counter from 1 to 2 on your first turn.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Card Levels">Card Levels</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Card levels for attaining 'a better card' are as follows: 1 (Pet rock), 2 (Peasant), 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (Noble), Baron, Queen, King. Level stacking: even if all remaining cards of a type have been used up, for example, barons, you can still create a queen. Let's say you have a baron and 2 nobles. The enemy has 3 barons. You wouldn't be able to make a queen, right? Well, you actually still can, you just have to combine all the cards in one go rather than multiple. This also helps save time with number card combinations and level stacking can be used at anytime as a quality of life feature.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Limited Resources">Limited Resources</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>If you are combining into something that there is none left in the deck, you either forgo the combination if it was otherwise optional, but if it was a required combination then you will be forced to steal that card. If you have no thieves then you must discard one of the cards.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Sorcerers">Sorcerers</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>If you discard a sorcerer, you can then gain any card you already have, you can also duplicate thieves and heirs this way. Essentially cloning a card. However, you cannot clone Ace, the archmage, or any royal cards. This is the reason the combining of nobles is optional as it is the best duplicatable card and you would generally want to save at least one for cloning.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Card Text Colors">Card Text Colors</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>A simple way to tell whether a card is duplicatable via sorcerer is by looking at the color of the text on the card. Red text means it can be duplicated. Black text means it can't.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="The Archmage">The Archmage</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The archmage is a special card that can be obtained by combining 2 sorcerers by discarding them and then searching the royal deck for the archmage. It does nothing on its own but makes all of your future sorcerers have 2 uses as long as you have the archmage.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Nobles">Nobles</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The ten card is also called the noble and works similar to most number cards, but you are not forced to discard matches to get a better card. Also, the first time you get a noble in each game, draw two extra cards near the end of your turn as royal bonus. Nobles end drawing sessions.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="The Thief">The Thief</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The thief can be used to steal cards from the opponent in a special manner. If you are combining two cards to make a better card, instead of getting the better card from the discard or drawing pile, you can get it from the opponent by swapping a thief with them. For example, if the opponent had a queen, and you had two barons and a thief, you can discard the two barons and swap the opponents queen with your thief. Your opponent has lost their queen and gained a thief. You gained a queen and lost a thief.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Ace Stealing">Ace Stealing</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The Ace card in the royal deck is attained when combining 2 thieves by discarding them without using them. Ace does not do anything on it's own, but it has a special start of turn benefit called Ace stealing. Whatever your lowest number card is, except for pet rocks, steal all cards of that type from all opponents. If you have no number cards or your only number card(s) is a pet rock then you get no Ace stealing benefits.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Peasant Revolts">Peasant Revolts</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Unlike other number cards, peasants are not forced to be discarded to gain a higher number card. You can choose to keep them and if you get four of them you can discard all four and gain a baron.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="The Pet Rock Cult">The Pet Rock Cult</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Similar to peasants, instead of being forced to combine pet rocks into making a peasant, you can choose to keep them. If you get four pet rocks you can discard them to do the pet rock cult ritual, which allows to discard one card from the enemy without them getting any benefit. You can even force them to discard kings this way. A pet rock ritual can also be used to summon a bread card. If the opponent has a pet rock card that you want, if you have more pet rocks then them you can discard a sorcerer to steal all pet rocks from the enemy. If you have less pet rocks or an equal amount, you cannot do this.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="The Royal Bonus">The Royal Bonus</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The royal bonus is calculated based on your highest royal. If the highest royal you have is a baron, your royal bonus is 1 plus 1 for every 2 peasants you have. If the highest royal you have is a queen, then your royal bonus will equal the number of thiefs you have. Ace counts as two thieves. If the highest royal you have is a king, then your royal bonus will be 9 minus the highest number card you have. If you have no number cards or your only number card(s) is pet rocks, then no royal bonus. Pet rocks do not affect the royal bonus calculation. If your royal bonus comes from a king and is non-negative or zero, then it has a minimum equal to the amount of peasants you have or 1. If you have a king then you are not forced to combine peasants. If your royal bonus comes from a queen, then it also has a minimum of 1. At the end of your turn, you draw cards equal to the royal bonus you had at the start of your turn. This drawing session is not ended if you draw a match or a sorcerer, you will continue drawing until you draw as many as the royal bonus gives. If your royal bonus is any negative number, discard your highest number card to get rid of, if you have no number cards then get rid of your lowest royal card, if you have no royal cards then choose a card to get rid of. If you have no cards then, I don't even know honestly. In addition to the deletion of a card, you do not gain any royal bonus next turn.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Bread">Bread</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Bread cards can be hoarded in any quantity up to 4. You are not forced to discard any afterwards, you just no longer have the ability to gain more. Bread cards can be discarded 1 at a time. If you discard a bread card, then draw a card. Bread cards a reserve to draw more now or draw more later. Instead of using pet rock cult rituals to discard an enemy card, you can also use them to gain one bread which you can use to kickstart agriculture.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Farmer">Farmer</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Created when using a peasant and a bread card together. Farmers cannot be duplicated. On cycle 2 and 4, gain 1 bread card for every farmer you have. You can have a maximum of 5 farmers.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Silos">Silos</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Silos can be built for a cost equal to your max bread. They increase your maximum bread capacity by 4. This increases the cost of the next silo by 4 bread. You can have a maximum of 3 silos.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Appointing an Heir">Appointing an Heir</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>If you have at least one king, one queen, and one baron, you can appoint a baron of yours as the heir by flipping it on its backside. If you lose a king from a pet rock ritual or from thief stealing, discard your heir and gain a king from the royal deck. If there is no king in the royal deck you can use thief stealing as this counts as an upgrade from an heir to a king. The same applies for a queen. You can use the sorcerer to duplicate heirs. However, if you don't have the archmage, you need two sorcerers to dupe an heir. Duplicated heirs must be a flipped over baron. If there is none left in the deck then you cant not appoint an additional heir. If you have a king and a queen and one is lost, then the other is automatically lost as well due to heart attack. If you lose multiple kings/queens then you must lose the other until you've discarded equal to the amount you lost or you run out of them. If you have only one heir, if you lose a king or queen, you lose both and choose one to keep. Combining 2 queens into a king does not count as the loss of a queen. Multiple heirs allows you to recover more and you can choose to gain a free king/queen if you still have heirs left after full recovery or gain additional heirs equal to the amount of heirs you have after recovery. Heirs can be reverted back to barons at any time at the cost of 1 bread.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Scientists">Scientists</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The scientist card can be used to have more control over your cards and make combinations more powerful through alchemy. Just like most other cards, it can be stolen by thieves and must be obtained by combining. It cannot be cloned with the sorcerer. To obtain a scientist card from the royal deck, combine 2 pet rocks, 2 peasants, and a noble. For number cards 3-9, you are forced to combine them, this means that the combination factor for these cards is 1. Scientists increase the combination factor of all number cards by 1. If your combination factor was 2, you can have a maximum of 2 of these number cards before being forced to combine 2 of them at 3. 3 combination factor means you can have a maximum of 3 before being forced to combine the 4 into 2 better ones. Combination factor of 4 or above means you are never forced to combine them. Default combination factors are as follows: numbers 3-9 have 1, 1-2 have 3, and all other cards have 4.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Scientists Continued">Scientists Continued</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Scientists also increase the maximum combination combo of all cards. Combining 2 cards makes a better card. This is 2 combination combo. 3 combination combo allows you to merge 3 of the same card into a card 2 levels higher. 4 combination combo allows you to merge 4 of the same card into a card 4 levels higher. This is affected by the limited resources described in the next section. Cards being not forced to combine by default does not mean they have a higher combination combo. Cards that require multiple different cards to make need one more of each card to count as a higher combo. Combining into a rank above a king creates 2 kings, and a rank 2 above a king creates 3 kings. If the opponent has kings however you can steal them with thiefs you may have and checkmate the opponent, but if they have heirs and thiefs then they may survive this 'checkmate'.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="The Knight">The Knight</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The knight is made using a noble and 2 pet rocks. Knights can be stolen but not cloned. At the start of each of your turns, you can choose either one or two of your opponents cards to attack. Attacking one will downgrade that card by 2 levels. If its level becomes below 1, then it is discarded. Attacking two downgrades both cards by 1 level. Barons require 3 damage at once to downgrade once. Queens require 6, and kings require 9. If the knight has more damage then it can downgrade more single target at once or more crowd control at once. This can be split any way you would like. Knights can also be used to protect against opponent's armies. You can protect against damage up to what your damage is. Excess damage can then be used to attack. You can have a maximum of 5 knights.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="The Earjimlin">The Earjimlin</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The earjimlin is the hive mind of knights. It is created by combining 2 knights and a scientist. It makes all of your knights gain damage multiplier for every other knight; equal to the number of knights you have. If you have 1, each knight will deal normal damage. If you have 2, each knight will have 1.5x damage. If you have 3, each knight will have 2x damage, and so on. You can have a maximum of 1 earjimlin.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="The Explorer">The Explorer</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The explorer can be used in special ways to obtain any card in the game with much less hassle. The explorer can be created using a queen, a baron, and a 2 bread. You can only have a maximum of 1 explorer at a time. If it is cycle 1, you may choose to begin an exploration. Feed the explorer two bread every one of your turns including the beginning turn and on the next cycle 1, you will have the opportunity to get any card in the game. If the enemy has all of that type then you must thief steal them to obtain them. If you skip an explorer bread payment mid-exploration then the explorer dies. You do not gain the bonus card and the explorer must be discarded.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Winning">Winning</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>You win after obtaining a certain amount of kings. In the base game with 2 players, you win with 4 kings. In the expansion pack with 3 players, you win with 6 kings.</p>
